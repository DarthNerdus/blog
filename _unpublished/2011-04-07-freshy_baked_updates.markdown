As I've increased usage of my MarsEdit-Jekyll static blog system I've started to flush out certain areas more to my liking. Here's a few of the things I've done since I first posted about it:

* Changed how the sitemap is generated.
* Added example posts illustrating how to write things up in MarsEdit.
* Added a YouTube layout Ã  la Tumblr.
* Added Draft functionality.
* Added timestamp support for multiple posts per day.

Little things that add up to a workable system for me. Again, feel free to [fork it](http://github.com/jessereadd/jessereadd.github.com) and make it better.
