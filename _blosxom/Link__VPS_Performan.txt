> Aside from cost, performance was the most important criteria for me when selecting a provider for was it up?. 5 different benchmarks were carried out every 3 hours over a week, leading to 56 runs each. The slowest system used up to 3 hours to complete all 5 benchmarks. Weeklong benchmarking was used to account for variance in host load during the day/night and week. I speculated that the host systems could be more utilizied on weekdays when people in the US were awake (all providers under test were US based). At the end of this article you'll find a table summarizing the averages and standard deviations of the 5 benchmarks on all providers.

In the end, Linode won out with both their 32-bit and 64-bit platforms. Much more in-depth performance reports that nicely support my previous VPS comparison.
