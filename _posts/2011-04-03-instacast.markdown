>Now, I realize that to have already written almost 600 words may seem like a lot to simply describe the awkwardness of trying to keep a podcast up to date. But: (a) I think we’ve all figured out by now that I have an affinity for writing about these types of things in detail; and (b) I’m trying to paint a picture for why I hardly ever listened to podcasts — up until a few weeks ago there was just no simple way to keep up with them.

Shawn gives a great review of [Instacast](http://www.vemedio.com/products/instacast), an iOS app that has greatly improved my podcast consumption in nearly every way. It has completely replaced iTunes' podcast functionality for me. Finding and subscribing to the shows I enjoy is delightfully easy and the ability to keep up-to-date and download new content without having to sync has reignited my love for a good podcast. My backlog had grown to nearly a **month** of playtime in untouched shows. Now I've declared Podcast Bankruptcy and enjoy new content on a daily basis.

I should also plug a few of the great shows I enjoy:

* [5by5](http://5by5.tv/) --- All of Dan Benjamin & Co.'s broadcasts.
* [Core Intuition](http://www.coreint.org/) --- Daniel Jalkut and Manton Reece's Mac Development podcast.
* [iDeveloper Live](http://ideveloper.tv/shows) --- Scotty's reincarnation of the MDN Show.
* [The B&B Podcast](http://thebbpodcast.com/) --- A tech show hosted by Ben Brooks and Shawn himself.
