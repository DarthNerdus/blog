> [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com/) is not just a Git client. This [comment](http://www.hackerne.ws/item?id=2684483) on Hacker News says it best:

>> They haven't re-created the git CLI tool in a GUI, they've created something different. They've created a tool that makes Git more accessible. Little things like auto-stashing when you switch branches will confuse git veterans, but it will make Git much easier to grok for newcomers because of the assumptions it makes about your Git workflow.
Why not bring this innovation back to the command line?

[Legit](https://github.com/kennethreitz/legit) works to apply the same high-reaching [goals](http://warpspire.com/posts/designing-github-mac/) that Kyle Neath set for GitHub to the command line. Sexy indeed.

I can't help but feel that the project would be more useful as a set of scripts to be integrated with git itself. This would allow for the use of a single command instead of using legit for local/remote interaction but relying on git itself for committing.
