>It’s no secret that the Mac App Store is a terrific new distribution channel for developers. Apple also provides plenty of documentation on how to prepare your app for submission.

>Unfortunately, there’s not much information on how to create a product that can also be distributed through more traditional channels, such as your own product website. This guide will help you update your Xcode projects to make it as simple as possible to create products for both channels simultaneously.

He always offers sound advice.
