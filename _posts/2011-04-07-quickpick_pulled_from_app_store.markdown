>QuickPick is being kicked out of the App Store.  
It doesnâ€™t matter that QuickPick existed years before Launchpad.  
Rejected.  
Period.

This is upsetting. 

While I personally don't like it, I can understand Apple's stance on rejecting applications that too closely mirror built-in functionality. But to approve an app and then pull it *later* is ludicrous. It doesn't help the fact that the MAS opened just a short while ago. If they wanted to reject it, they should have done so then. 

I feel that, while far from optimal, rejecting applications at the time of submission is far more acceptable than removing them after the fact. If Apple wants to Sherlock someone, fine. But at least let them continue to sell their product to those who find the built-in functionality less satisfying.
